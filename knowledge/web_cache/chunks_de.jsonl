A challenge in any discussion of\ncurrent and future DT research is the vast breadth and depth of lit-\nerature already published and the rapid and exponential increase\nin new research entering the literature. Many efforts have attempted\nto produce comprehensive DT literature reviews and synthesize\nDT research across all disciplines and in individual \ufb01elds\n[12,15,56,195,210,489\u2013493], but we are unaware of any that have\nfully succeeded in their goals. Indeed, our own efforts in this\narticle fall far short of fully surveying the DT literature and fully\nrepresenting all possible future DT research directions. Instead,\nwe focused on the 13 areas identi\ufb01ed by the RFI [8] plus others\nwe found to be relevant and worthy of mention. We also chose to\nstay within our individual and collective areas of expertise to\navoid speak"}

While we believe the DT research direc-\ntions we proposed are valid and worthy of further funding and\nresearch, we urge the community to continue exploring new\nresearch trajectories beyond those that we proposed.\nIt should be noted that while we alluded to AI being distinct and\nseparate from DT in Sec.3.2.5, there is no consensus in the commu-\nnity.

We observe that the theme of data cross-cuts\nthrough many of the 14 areas of future DT research including\nSecs. 6.1, 6.3, 6.8, 6.10, 6.12, and 6.13. A DT must have data to\nexist. Data are a fundamental underpinning of a DT.\nThe cross-cutting theme of data starts with a need to structure and\norganize DT data such as with an ontology as identi\ufb01ed in Sec.6.10.\nThis further indicates a need to standardize how data are collected,\nstored, and processed across DTs. Next, it logically follows that\nregulatory"}

This also includes an empha-\nsis on data provenance.\nIn order for AI to take advantage of DTs, AI must have access to\nvast amounts of data to build robust models of the world, the\nsystem, and implement this into the DT. Without copious, high-\nquality, relevant data being made available in a standardized\nformat, AI likely will not produce useful results. As with AI in\ngeneral, data coming from DTs to feed AI must be reasonably\nfree of poisoned or otherwise manipulated data that could\nproduce believable but false results.\n7.2.2 Return on Investment."}

While Sec. 6.7 speci\ufb01cally discusses DT\nover the long term, we noticed that many of the other sections\nhave underlying long-term themes. For instance, Sec.6.14 is not\nonly about workforce development but also about sustainment of\nDTs through having a long-term workforce pipeline to continue\nproducing quali\ufb01ed workers ready to build, operate, and maintain\nDTs for decades to come. Section6.11 discusses DT sustainability,\nwhich by its very nature is a long-term issue.

In addition to the extensive future work laid\nout in Sec.6, we see a need for a new agreed upon and standardized\nde\ufb01nition of DT that is acceptable to all research communities and\nindustries.

However, we have observed\nsome colleagues de\ufb01ning DT to mean control systems, other col-\nleagues de\ufb01ning DT as only 3D models that are infrequently or\nnever updated, and a number of other de\ufb01nitions exist in the litera-\nture that may be outside of the main body of DT research.

Further, some of these\ncomponents may run past initial warranties offered by vendors due to\nextended periods sitting on the shelf waiting to be installed. With a DT,\nless than 1 of each spare is required.

When comparing these sparing requirements to\nthe post-DT fielded solution, it quickly becomes clear that there is high\nutility in scenarios like this for the fielding of DTs.\n5 DISCUSSION\nThis article develops a methodology that walks systems engineers\nthrough the development of a PHM-centric DT system in parallel to\nthe physical asset being developed.

As described by Klaus Schwab, founder of the World Economic \nForum, the 4th IR will be driven largely by the convergence of digital, biological and \nphysical innovation [2]. One could understand the 4th IR as the blurring of boundaries \nbetween the digital, biological, and physical world. This is made possible with rapidly \nincreasing computing power and data transfer rates. It brings about great potential to increase \nproductivity, while communication will be easier and transportation will be faster [11], \nthereby enabling the proliferation of technology in the \ufb01elds of Internet-of-Things (IOT), \nArti\ufb01cial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning, 3D printing and genetic engineering to \nname a few [12].

Just as in other industries, the 4th IR has made its impact on the military. \nAs Farrell and Terri\ufb00 [13] identified, there are three drivers for military change including \n(1) pressure from senior leadership, (2) emulation of other professional militaries, and (3) \nan external shock . We argue that the 4th IR is fueling all three military change drivers with \nthe pace and extent of the 4th IR proliferating across di\ufb00erent technologies used by the \nmilitary. For instance, United States (U.S.) Department of Defense (DOD) was reported to \nhave increased its unclassi\ufb01ed investments in AI from 600 million dollars in FY2016 to 2.5 \nbillion dollars in FY2021 [14].

INTRODUCTION\n1.1 The Digital Age for Aerospace and Defense Missions\nAs the aerospace and defense sectors hurtle into the digital era, the necessity to reshape\nexisting mission engineering (ME) practices to accommodate the rapidly expanding \ufb01eld of\ndigital engineering (DE) has become more critical. The current state of mission engineering\nis hindered by ambiguous guidelines that provide little support or direction for the incor-\nporation of integrated digital tools, thereby demanding the formulation of more explicit,\nstandardized methodologies. Considerable progress has been made in transitioning from\ndocument-centric to model-based digital activities utilizing Model-Based Systems Engineer-\ning (MBSE); however, these e\ufb00orts have primarily focused on system and sub-system level\nmodeling in the early stages of conceptual studies.

However, there is a con-\nspicuous absence of e\ufb00orts dedicated to constructing a comprehensive, holistic perspective\nof a mission, emphasizing the urgent need for a revised approach.\nThe integration of DE and MBSE presents substantial bene\ufb01ts for managing complex\nsystems, particularly within ME processes.

BACKGROUND\n2.1 Digital Engineering\nDigital engineering is an integrated digital approach that leverages a uni\ufb01ed source of\ndata and models that are pulled from various disciplines to support lifecycle activities from\nconception through disposal [ 17 ]. This digital approach combines advanced technologies,\nmodel-based techniques, and computational tools to enable optimized solutions through\na digital engineering ecosystem [ 14 ]. The digital engineering ecosystem encompasses the\ninterconnected infrastructure, environment, and methodology employed to store, access, an-\nalyze, and visualize the evolving data and models of systems. It provides a comprehensive\nframework comprising processes, methods, and tools that cater to the needs of stakeholders,\ncreating an end-to-end digital enterprise [ 23 ]\nWithin the digital engineering ecosystem"}

The following sections summarize those efforts.\n2.1 Literature review of MBSE benefits\nThe first work this paper builds on was an adapted systematic liter-\nature review.13 The goal of the literature review was to evaluate the\nstate of the literature with respect to substantiated evidence of MBSE\nbenefits. Twenty journals and conferences from the areas of SE, engi-\nneering design, and space SE were selected for analysis. All papers\nthat mentioned \u201cMBSE\u201d were reviewed for any mention of benefits.\nThe benefits were also categorized based on how those claims were\nsupported. These categori"}

No restriction as to the type of benefit,\nbenefit claim, or claim context was applied. If the author(s) of a paper\nclaimed that because of MBSE, a positive characteristic was added\nor improved, or a negative characteristic was removed or reduced,\nsuch a claim was recorded as a benefit. A total of 1233 individually\nclaimed benefits were found in 360 papers. The results were aggre-\ngated into 48 benefit categories. The distribution of benefits across\nthe 48 benefits was fairly even, with the most cited benefit only taking\nup about 10% of total benefit occurrences.

Second, interface defects were discovered earlier, when it is\ntypically less expensive to fix. Third, MBSE produced a higher quality\nproduct, in terms of total number of defects found.

The authors also note additional qualitative and observed\nbenefits throughout.\nWhen examining the validated links, it is apparent that the major-\nity of the validation includes more easily quantifiable benefits such as\nreduce errors/defects, reduce rework, reduce time, and reduce cost.\nThis program appeared to have used metrics that were already being\ncaptured, such as labor hours, number of changed interface require-\nments (effort), interface defects found over time, and average cost per\nbaseline change request.\nOne of the requirements in their tool is that the model needs to be\ninternally consistent. Because the relationships between elements are\nbetter captured in models, more defects were discovered in the legacy\nSE products (which were used to build the model).

Using the causal model, you can trace\nthe origins that contribute to this change in efficiency (see Figure11).\nThe key contributors toeffort and time are: Reduce SE burden, Reduce\nrework,a n dEasy to make changes.
